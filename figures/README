each directory contains a script to generate a TYPE or category of plot
- 100ns_observation_plots contains scripts to generate plots from 100ns unbiased MD
- FEP_plots contains scripts to generate free energy estimates as a function of time
- 2D_umbrella_plots contains scripts to generate 2D FE contour plots from umbrella sampling data
- benchmarking contains scripts to generate the plots we show to benchmark our system parameters

all data is contained in the data subdirectory - appropriately named and categorized

the workflow to generate this data is here: (should be here, but this needs a lot more work...to do priority)
https://github.com/HeydenLabASU-collab/host-guest

or here

/mesa1/bdneff/host-guest_project/host-guest_sample_setup


but these should be the same...
