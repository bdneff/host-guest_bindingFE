## `host-guest_sample_setup/`

Contains scripts and input files for setting up and running alchemical binding free energy calculations.  
The README in this directory provides instructions for running an example host–guest system. The workflow is identical for other systems.

## `figures/`

Contains scripts used to process simulation output and generate figures.  
The README in this directory describes how the figures are produced from completed simulations.
